# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository — and to the Gemina FileTag MCP server's public contract — will be documented here. We follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for the server's response shape.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-19

### Changed
- Moved registry icon from `raw.githubusercontent.com/tommyil/gemina-mcp/...` to `https://www.gemina.co/assets/filetag-logo.png`. Stable, branded URL that survives any future repo rename or org move.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-19

### Added
- `icons` array on `server.json` pointing at the 400×400 logo so registry-aware clients (Smithery, Glama, Cline) can render it in listings.

### Changed
- Bumped `server.json` schema to `2025-12-11/server.schema.json` (was draft `2025-06-18`).
- Stripped `server.json` to schema-compliant fields only; trimmed `description` to ≤100 chars to pass registry validation.
- Migrated the rich metadata (vendor, tools, supported file types, rate limits, pricing, keywords) into `glama.json`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-19

### Added
- Initial public release of the discovery and install repository.
- README with quick install snippets for nine MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code, Cline, Windsurf, Codex CLI, OpenClaw, Hermes-Agent).
- `llms-install.md` for AI agent auto-discovery.
- MCP registry manifest (`server.json`) and Glama manifest (`glama.json`).
- Example workflows: `curl-quickstart`, `bulk-tag-folder`, `claude-desktop`, `gmail-attachment-triage`, `llamaindex-reader`, `langchain-loader`.
- GitHub Actions workflows for linting examples, validating install snippets, and weekly link checks.
- 400×400 PNG logos (`assets/logo.png` and `assets/logo-dark.png`) for marketplace listings.
- Synthetic sample PDFs (`assets/sample-input/{invoice,receipt,contract}.pdf`) and a ReportLab generator script.
